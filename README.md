# ECE 364 (sp25) repo for Final Project Topic 2: Twitter Analysis

The specific details of the topic can be found in the ECE364_tweet_analysis.pdf file inside this repository. The program for training, validation, and testing of the model can all be found in the 364_final_proj_code.ipynb. The data imports assume that the tsv files are in the same repository so, before running the program, be sure that this is the case. The train time is approximately 8 - 9 minutes for 10 epochs for a validation accuracy of 76.8%.
